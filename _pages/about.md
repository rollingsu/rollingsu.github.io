HiðŸ™Œ, I'm Zhaolong Su, a senior student at Beijing University of Technology, and I am currently honored to be conducting summer research at Johns Hopkins University under the guidance of Bloomberg Distinguished Professor Alan Yuille. Previously, I had a wonderful experience at the AIMED lab at the University of Hong Kong and DCML group at Peking University. 
My research interest includes computer vision, machine learning, and computational biology.
In my spare time, I enjoy gym, sports, reading.
