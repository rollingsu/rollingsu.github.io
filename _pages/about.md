Hiüôå, I'm Zhaolong Su, a senior student at Beijing University of Technology, and a Incoming PhD at William & Mary. My research interests primarily focus on Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Multimodal Learning.

I am a researcher at Johns Hopkins University, working with Bloomberg Distinguished **Prof. Alan Yuille**. Prior to that, I  worked at Peking University, supervised by **Prof. Wentao Zhang**. I also had a wonderful experience at HKU, we have promoted the development and application of CT-free scoliosis treatment. I am also interning at Chinese Academy of Sciences(CAS) supervised by **Prof.Guoqi Li**.

Recently, I organized a seminar with Professor Xin Zhou from Vanderbilt(Vandy) University and Professor Shan Wang from the Vandy wet lab. While I may not directly pursue this field, I find it incredibly interesting.
