HiðŸ™Œ, I'm Zhaolong Su, a senior student at Beijing University of Technology, and I am currently honored to be conducting summer research at Johns Hopkins University under the guidance of Professor Alan Yuille. Previously, I had a wonderful experience at University of Hong Kong and Peking University. 

As an ordinary person, but I hope to contribute my modest efforts to advancing AI and the development of the world. My research interests primarily focus on **Computer Vision, Multimodal Learning, Self-Supervised Learning**, enabling AI to understand the world more humans-like and helping machines comprehend more supervised information.

I have a particular passion for photography, reading, and fitness. Fellow enthusiasts of literature, history, and philosophy are also welcome to connect with me!

PSï¼šIn the field of bioinformatics, AI might create more world-class impacts. Recently, I organized a seminar with Professor Xin Zhou from Vanderbilt(Vandy) University and Professor Shan Wang from the Vandy wet lab. While I may not directly pursue this field, I find it incredibly interesting.
